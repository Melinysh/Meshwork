Created by David Tsenter, Jonathan Galaperin, Sam Haves, and Stephen Melinyshyn.

You can find it on [DevPost](http://devpost.com/software/meshwurk-m8dxk1).

Meshwurk uses Apple's Multipeer Connectivity framework to find people around you and makes it a breeze to add their contact info to your phone. Meshwurk also allows you to see if there are people nearby that you know and displays all your peers in a beautiful graph. Meshwurk requires no internet connection to function, unlike other contact sharing apps.
